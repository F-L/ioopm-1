* Installing IOOPM Software
  There is a frequent question about how to install gcc and emacs on a
  variety of operating systems. We therefore decided to provide this
  little guide for your convenience.

** Ubuntu
   - Open a terminal :: Click on the Ubuntu Logo in the top right and
        type "terminal". Pause a second to complain about the
        advertisements you're seeing. Now press <enter>.

   - Install GCC + Emacs :: execute this following line, then enter your password:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
   sudo apt-get install build-essential emacs24
#+END_SRC

      *Congratulations, you're done!*
** Mac OS X
*** GCC
    - Open the App Store :: press [apple-key+<space>] and type "App Store<enter>"
    - Install Xcode :: Type "xcode<enter>" into the search bar in the
                       top right. Click on the Xcode application and
                       on the install button. This will give you gcc,
                       alongside Apple's Xcode IDE.

    iCal-prenumerationer]].

      *Congratulations, you're done!*
** Windows
*** Virtualbox
    - Virtualbox :: Download and install [[https://www.virtualbox.org/][Virtualbox]].
    - Ubuntu :: Download an up-to-date version of ubuntu as .iso-file
                from [[http://www.ubuntu.com]].
    - Create a Virtualbox Virtual Machine :: Start Virtualbox and
         click "New". Call your machine "Ubuntu" and the wizard will
         walk you through it.
    - Pick the ISO :: Use the ubuntu-iso as virtual CD :: Go to the
         settings of your newly created Virtual Machine, click on the
         CD icon. Choose the .iso file containing your ubuntu
         distribution.

         [[./windows_pick_iso.png]]

         Close the settings dialog.
    - Start the Virtual Machine :: Doubleclick on the Virtual Machine
         you created and configured, it will boot. Exciting, right? :)
    - Install Ubuntu :: Just follow the simple wizard and you'll be
                        fine. (Btw, when asked whether it's ok to delete the
                        contents of the hard drive: yes it is, the
                        "hard drive" of your ubuntu is just a file on
                        your actual hard drive.)
    - Goto Ubuntu :: Log in and continue at the instructions for Ubuntu above.

      *Congratulations, you're almost done!*
